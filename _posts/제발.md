The leaky integrate and fire model is a special case of the Spike Response Model. To see this, take the differential equation of the leaky integrate-and-fire model

$\frac{dv}{dt} = - \frac{v - v_{eq}}{\tau} + I(t)$

where $v$ is the membrane potential, $v_{eq}$ is the equilibrium potential and $\tau = RC$ is the membrane time constant.
